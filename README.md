# PSQI psychometric properties in a sample of patients with mood disorders

This repository contains the analysis for a manuscript on PSQI psychometric
properties in a sample of patients with mood disorders (bipolar disorder, major
depression with current depressive episode, and major depression with no mood
episode).

The directory structure was split into three main directories:

- `scripts`: Numbered source files separated by task (e.g. `02_descriptive.R`)
starting from 01 up to 06 (1-indexed just like R).
- `data`: Sub-divided in `raw`, `processed`, and `metadata`. The sub-directories
were created to store raw data files (i.e. the `sav` SPSS file), processed
intermediate data objects and metadata files such as dictionaries and additional
documentation, respectively.
- `output`: Includes two child directories (`fig` and `tbl`) for exporting of
figures and tables, respectively.
